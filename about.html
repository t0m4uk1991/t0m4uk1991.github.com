		<p>
            This simple and minimalistic site was created as the place to keep some ideas and solutions "at hand". It is developed using Jekyll - ruby-based static site generator, the pages are written in Markdown and the site is hosted on GitHub, also I disable google indexing of this site, so don't try to ask google about it.
