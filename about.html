    <h2>About this site<h2>
	<div class="about-section">
		<p>
            This simple and minimalistic site was created as the place to keep some ideas and solutions "at hand". It is developed using Jekyll - ruby-based static site generator, the pages are written in Markdown and the site is hosted on GitHub, also I disable google indexing of this site, so don't try to ask google about it. And one more thing. English is not my native language, but I promise to write as well as I can, nevertheless, I will make mistakes, so, if you find one, please let me know.
